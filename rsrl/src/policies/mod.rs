//! Agent policies module.
//!
//! This module contains fixed and parameterised policies for reinforcement
//! learning control problems. A policy is considered to be either deterministic
//! or stochastic, for which we have the following definitions, respectively: 1)
//! _π(X) -> U_; 2) _π(X, U) -> R_, or equivalently, _π(x) -> Ω(U)_; where _X_
//! and _U_ are the state and action spaces, respectively; _R_ is the set
//! of real values; and _Ω(U)_ is the set of probability measures on the action
//! set _U_. In general, deterministic policies may be considered a special case
//! of stochastic policies in which all probability mass is placed on a single
//! action _u'_ for any given state _x_. For continuous policies, this can be
//! seen as a dirac delta distribution, _δ(u' - u)_.
